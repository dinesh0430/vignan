			<p class = "tnp-desc">   Industry Interaction should continue to remain the sole responsibility of the Institution. In other words each Institution will continue to be responsible and accountable for the Placement of its Passouts, for which they will perform all activities including liaison with Corporate and Companies, Accreditation of their Institutions with Corporate and Companies, etc.</p>
			<p class = "tnp-desc">	However, whenever a Corporate or Company is called by an Institution, they will find out all the Programmes, whose Passouts are eligible for Placement and inform all other Institutions, for sending eligible pass outs. Placement is the sole responsibility of Students. The Training and Placement cell (TnP) and various other Faculty members only facilitate and provide the guidance to the students</p>
